The back_end will be a REST API.
RULES
We are going to use 'models' for database handling 
And we use 'resources' for the object our client is going
to interact with.

This means that when we read/write from a database -> 'model'

When we are receiving/sending data from the clients (website that classifies images) -> 'resource'.

Both 'models' and 'resources' are classes.
